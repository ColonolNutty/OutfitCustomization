For more mods like this support me at my Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/colonolnutty

### Features:

- Customize clothing pieces/accessories your sim is wearing without going into CAS
  - Put on or Take off clothing items on the fly
    - Example: Put On/Take Off Glasses without hassle! (This mod does not come with glasses, get your own!)
    - Extensible: You can add your own clothing items to work with this mod without needing to modify the CAS item itself. (Modders, see below)
 

### Planned Features:

- Update the Dialog to be more like a "Sim" picker visually (although you'd be picking cas parts instead)
  - Enable Outfit Customization for children and toddlers
  - The Bulge will NOT be enabled and OC will take no responsibility for what people decide to add after this change
  - If you ask me to add a Crotch Bulge for them, you will be reported!
- Add the ability to add a part to ALL outfits of a sim.
- Add the ability to remove a part from ALL outfits of a sim.
- Add Outfit Sets to enable equipping/unequipping entire sets of clothing
  - Custom Set names
  - Add/Remove cas parts from each set
  - Specify the slot to equip a cas part in
 

### Mods that add to this:

- Do let me know in the support thread or the discord if you add stuff to this mod and I can link it here!
  - Just remember that OC is by itself a Non-Adult mod and breaks no rules, however linked content may or may not break LL rules depending on what said linked content adds to OC, OC is not responsible for the content that mod authors add to it. If linked content does break LL rules, please bring it to my attention and I will unlink it from the description
