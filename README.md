### Features:

- Customize clothing pieces/accessories your sim is wearing without going into CAS
  - Put on or Take off clothing items on the fly
    - Example: Put On/Take Off Glasses without hassle! (This mod does not come with glasses, get your own!)
    - Extensible: You can add your own clothing items to work with this mod without needing to modify the CAS item itself. (Modders, see below)
 

### Planned Features:

- Update the Dialog to be more like a "Sim" picker visually (although you'd be picking cas parts instead)
- Add the ability to add a part to ALL outfits of a sim.
- Add the ability to remove a part from ALL outfits of a sim.
- Add Outfit Sets to enable add and remove of entire sets of outfit parts
  - Custom Set names
  - Add/Remove cas parts from each set
  - Specify the slot to equip a cas part in
